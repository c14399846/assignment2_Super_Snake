Game : 
  Snake 

Goal :
  The goal is to make a classic game that is class-based.
  
  It must use programming practices such as inheritance, polymorhpism, abstract classes,
  sound files, animations, while being procedural in nature ( e.g spawning of enemies or buffs).
  
Features(That I hope to implement):
  Interfaces - menu system
  
  High-score storage
    reaching a certain high score will unlock other difficulties
    
  Various difficulty settings
    Easy,Normal,Hard
      Normal has increased speed, and addition of walls(?)
      Hard has increased speed, removal of tracking lines, and addition of walls
      
  Multiple powerups
    size-increase, score-increasing, invulnerability(?)
    Reaching a certain number of powerups or score will make walls appear

How things are done:
  snake, powerups (fruit/mouse) are given their own class, with lives, speed, size(?), etc,
  which will extend a position/Pvector class - gObjects
  
  guidelines are drawn in a function x frames (120) per sec
  
  All modes (?) will let you go through oppoiste wall, Hard mode, or an Extreme mode could exclude this bit of code
  
  walls are given their own function; only activate when in Normal/Hard mode, and when score = 1000 or 15 powerups are collected
    
  Fruits can also be a moving object / timed object - based on framerate counting
