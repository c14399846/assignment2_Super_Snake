*****Images of the game are in the gameScreenshots folder*****

*****YOU NEED TO SELECT A GAMEMODE TO START THE GAME*****

Uses two powerups mouse and fruit(cherry), which increase snake size when eaten.

Movement: W(up) A(left) S(down) D(right)

Death (snake):
	Going past the sides of the game, or touching itself.

Death (mouse and cherry):
	getting eaten by snake, will respawn to new area.

Use reset button to set high score to 0.

Use mute button to turn sounds on/off (it's a toggle).

Info screen contains this same information.
	
Images used are made by me, you can repurpose them if needed.

The game is largely, but not fully, dynamic, which means you can change the game size
and the game will still function as intended. Buttons and status text -might- look wonky,
but are still understandable and don't block much of teh ui.
