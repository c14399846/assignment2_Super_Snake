# assignment2_Super_Snake Class-based snake game made in processing(java).



Uses two powerups mouse and fruit(cherry), which increase snake size when eaten.

Movement: W(up) A(left) S(down) D(right)

Death (snake):
	Going past the sides of the game, or touching itself.

Death (mouse and cherry):
	getting eaten by snake, will respawn to new area.
	
Images used are made by me, you can repurpose them if needed.


The game is largely, but not fully dynamic, which means you can chaneg the game size
and the game will still function as intended.
